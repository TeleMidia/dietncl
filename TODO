  + filter.import: Check circular imports.

    The resolve_importbase() and resolve_importncl() functions, in
    filter/import.lua, should check if the target URI was imported in a
    previous call.  If this is the case, they should silently remove the
    <importBase> or <importNCL> element from the source document.
