DietNCL TODO -- Tasks that need implementing.                  -*-outline-*-

* KNOWN BUGS

* FEATURES OR PROBLEMS

  + filter.import: Use 'documentURI' as importation prefix.

    An imported <descriptor> should refer to the correct region even if this
    was imported by another <importBase> element.

  + filter.import: Replace '#' by some valid string.

    We may use SHA1 (together with a collision table) to compute new ids.

  + test-filter-import.lua: Check multiple inclusions of the same file.

  + test-filter-import.lua: Check circular inclusion.

    The resolve_importbase() and resolve_importncl() functions, in
    filter/import.lua, should check if the target URI was imported in a
    previous call.  If this is the case, they should silently remove the
    <importBase> or <importNCL> element from the source document and return.

* OPTIMIZATION AND CLEAN UP

  + dietncl/filter/prenorm*.lua: Revise pre-norm filters.

    Some are unfinished.
